        Hi there, my name is Kirk Hagglund. Welcome to my page, powered by
        React. I'm originally from Toronto, but recently relocated to Costa
        Rica. I'm working my way through a full stack coding bootcamp
        administered by the University of Toronto.
      </p>

        Previously, I was involved in the Toronto restaurant industry, working
        as a Sommelier and wine program director, and mid level manager at
        several reputable destinations. During the pandemic I had much more time
        to foster hobbies and interests, where I rediscovered my love for
        puzzles and problem solving.
